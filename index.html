	<p>I am a FONDECYT Fellow working at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. My research focusses on understanding how galaxies have evolved through studying the star-formation histories of their individual components, such as bulges and discs. In particular, I am interested in S0 and dwarf galaxies in nearby clusters. </p>
