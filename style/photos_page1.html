        <h1>Thursday 18th December</h1>
        <p>It's coming up to Christmas, so all the retailers are trying to cash in on seasonal buying. By the looks of it, their logic runs thus: christmas means winter; winter means snow; therefore, to make things look christmassy, you add snow. I love the example below. Cherries. A beautiful summer fruit that has just come into season, decorated with snowflakes to sell them as a christmas snack. </p>

        <p>Incidentally, the pack was full originally. They were just too delicious to leave lying around for long.</p>
  
        <p>Chileans also really like their artwork, and are proud to display it throughout the city. There are statues and monuments everywhere. In Vitacura, the part of Santiago where my office is located, they have commissioned local artists to decorate some benches. Here are a few examples, I pass about 10 of these on my way into work in the morning.</p>

        <h1>Wednesday 17th December</h1>
        <p>As they say, the way to a mans heart is through his stomach. Well, that doesn't work with Boris and me- he's by far the better cook (and knows it), and I'm a greedy pig who prefers to eat his offerings than improve my own. Well, to be honest, all attempts at recreating his masterpieces have failed. Anyway, our relationship is based on mocking and teasing each other, and my new way of doing that out here is by showing him the German foods that I can buy in Chile but are not available in the UK. This is because Chile has a huge German population, larger I guess than the UK, and so they import all their old favourites.  </p>
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/german_foods.jpg" width="300"   alt="German_foods" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>The Marmor cake at the bottom is one of Boris' particular favourites, and is a chocolate and vanilla marble cake. I prefer to make my own than use the heavily processed one, but he's lazy (ssh, don't tell him I said that) and likes the flavour of this particular brand. Every time we make it, he gives me the lecture of how he's tried others and they don't compare... My next plan is to try to find some amazing german style sausages and maultaschen out here, and then I can really have fun with Boris.</p>
  
        <p>In the photo you can also see that some of the shops here even have electronic price tags, so theoretically when a products price changes, it can all be done remotely.</p>

        <h1>Tuesday 16th December</h1>
        <p>Apparently it's close to Christmas... </p>
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/Christmas_tree.jpg" width="600"   alt="Christmas_tree" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>Doesn't feel like it though :-p</p>
  
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/ESO_office.jpg"  width="600" alt="ESO_office" /></span></p> 
    
        <p>The top photo is the tree in the lobby of the office, and is pretty typical of what you see everywhere here. Not too many people go crazy here for christmas decorations apparently. The bottom picture is just the office grounds once you step through the security gate. The trees have suddenly burst into bloom in my absence, so there more pretty violet flowers around.</p>
