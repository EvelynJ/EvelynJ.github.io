        <h1>Tuesday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>Well, my stuff finally arrived, and my flat is now in chaos. The removal men said they would be here at 11:30, which normally means mid afternoon Chilean time. However, they were already here at 11:15. All my stuff has now arrived, with the only casualties being one broken bowl and one damaged but still useable door unit for my shelves. Anyway, as you can see, I've now put together all the big furniture, and just have to finish putting away all my clothes and books (contained in the 5 boxes next to the shelves). But those can wait until after my next shift. It's 8pm here, and I need to have dinner and pack my suitcase before the taxi picks me up at 7 tomorrow. </p>

        <h1>Monday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>I'm back in the office after a really nice weekend with Andrew and his family. On Saturday we went for a wee walk into La Serena to see the beach and the lighthouse in the morning, and then went for a drive into the nearby valleys to visit the reservoir and one of the villages out there. </p>
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/La_Serna_Castle.jpg" width="600"   alt="flight" /></span></p> 
        

        <div style="width:600px; height:540px; border:1px solid red; padding:5px;">
		<img alt="selfie stick" src="style/selfie_stick.jpg" style="width:295px;  border:1px solid blue; float:left;" />
		<img alt="fragile ladies" src="style/fragile_ladies.jpg" style="width:295px;  border:1px solid blue; float:right;" />
		</div>

        <p>The above images show the lighthouse on the beach, which is now the most basic tourist information office I've ever seen, and one of many statues in la Serena. The story is that another country donated a load of statues to Chile many years ago with the idea that they would be distributed throughout the country. But, the president at the time had other ideas. He was originally from La Serena, and so decreed that all the statues should be placed there, lining the road that eventually leads to the beach. I just loved the statue above as someone has gone along and placed 'fragile' stickers over certain fragile areas. We passed that way again the next day and those stickers were gone, but someone has followed the clean up crew and placed more stickers on other statues.</p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/santa_fire_engine.jpg" width="600"   alt="fire engine" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>We also stumbled across the decorated fire engine. Apparently each evening around Christmas it travels through the town with a consort of ambulances and police cars, all sounding their sirens, for Christmas. We heard it both days I was there, but I never got to see it in action, so can't say whether they were raising money for the fire service (which is completely voluntary here) or just throwing sweets out to children.</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/head.jpg" width="300"   alt="head" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>We also found an Easter Island head in the local museum.</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/reservoir1.jpg" width="600"   alt="reservoir1" /></span></p> 
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/reservoir2.jpg" width="600"   alt="reservoir2" /></span></p> 
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/reservoir3.jpg" width="600"   alt="reservoir3" /></span></p> 
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/reservoir_statue.jpg" width="600"   alt="reservoir_statue" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>The reservoir in the valley is pretty, but is very shallow at the moment. It's used mainly for agriculture, to irrigate the many many vinyards in that part of the country. Because it's been so empty for several years now, the farmers have reclaimed some of the land that used to be under water to grow crops. There were also several kite surfers at the far end of the reservoir, but when it's full apparently it is a major hub for kite surfers. The final photo shows a statue, which has some strings at the top to play notes when it's windy. It was wondy on the day we were there, and while it was a nice idea, the four strings were never tunes, so the noise is far from pleasant.</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/ice_cream.jpg" width="600"   alt="ice cream" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>We finished the reservoir trip with some ice cream. This was my mint choc chip ice cream. it was nice, but I hate to think what artificial colourings have gone into it to achieve such a lurid colour.</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/exit_Vicuna.jpg" width="600"   alt="exit_vicuna" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>We ended up in a small village called Vicuna. The road into and out of the village is shown above- a single lane bridge over the river, but with a beautiful view. The Christmas market was on on the day we visited, so we had fun wandering around the stalls.</p>    
        <p></p>    
        <p>On Sunday we decided to take it easy. We wandered around the market in the morning, picking up a lot of fresh fruit and veg that will not last long. I've already eaten about half the cherries I brought back with me, and have yet to start on the most flavoursome blueberries I have ever eaten. They are nothing like the tasteless ones you get in the supermarkets at home. Then, in the afternoon, we had a wander around the Japanese gardens.</p>

        <h1>Friday 19th December</h1>
        <p>Sorry, no fancy photos over the weekend. I'm off to la Serena tonight to see a friend for the weekend, and won't have my laptop with me. Besides, I will be too busy sampling the local wine to add any photos :-p</p>
