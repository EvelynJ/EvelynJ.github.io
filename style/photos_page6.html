        <h1>Sunday 4th January</h1>
        <p>Finally, my shift is almost over. My bags are packed, BBQ lunch has been eaten, and the bus arrives in 2 hours to collect me.</p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/packed.jpg" width="300"   alt="suitcase" /></span></p> 
 
        <p>I finally started to feel the exhaustion last night, and planned to have an easy night. But oh no, someone submitted a request for a target of opportunity- a short-term astronomical signal had beed detected yesterday afternoon and the observer wanted immediate data before it faded as we are still trying to figure out what these signals are. Anyway, it was my first such occasion, and the stuff the observer sent was rubbish. For example, he have us two different sets of coordinates to look at for a single object, and sent us a finding chart that didn't have any directions on it! Most astronomers and map makers know that you should mark North at the very least. Anyway, it was a tiring night, and I'm more than ready to have a few days off to relax :-)</p>

        <h1>Friday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>I slept in today, and didn't have time to fit in a swim before starting work. So, instead, I decided to walk down from the telescopes to the Residencia for dinner. It's about 45 minutes walk, or about an hour if you stop to take photos like me, and it's beautiful just walking through the desert. I treated myself to some cool polarized sunglasses before I moved to Chile, which not only stop me being blinded when I go up to the telescope platform, but also bring out the red colours of the desert. It's felt very Martian walking down today.</p>
        <p>Anyway, being I scientist, I started to wonder, how can I compare the real world and my tinted (and very pretty) version of it? Will the phone in my camera be able to focus through my sunglasses despite the strong prescription? Well, the anser is yes.</p>
        <p>Without sunglasses...</p>

        <p>In the photos above you can see the star trail path I followed, and in the distance is Cerro Amazones, the mountain they are blasting for the new big telescope, the E-ELT. You can also just about see the moon above and to the left of the mountain.</p>

        <h1>Thursday 1st January</h1>
        <p>It's the new year, night 8 of 10 on the mountain, and I'm nearly done :-)  Anyway, I realised I haven't shown you any of the food yet, apart from the latest menu choice of roast German. Well, here you go, my midnight snack- a mountain of fruit. You can order whatever you like from the list during the day, so my selection today was mango and pineapple. It's all beautifully fresh and ripe and healthy, and there's plenty of it to last me until I stop for dinner. As you can see, I'm eating it in the control room as the telescope operator (I control the instrument) has gone for his own dinner.</p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/fruit.jpg" width="300"   alt="rfuit" /></span></p> 
 
        <p>It's not all work though. I'm running a long exposure, about an hour, so have nothing to do during that time except eat my fruit and listen to 15 minute musical on youtube.</p>
