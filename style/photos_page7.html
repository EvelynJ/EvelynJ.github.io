        <h1>Thursday 8th January</h1>
        <p>As I mentioned yesterday on Skype, I've finally spotted the green parrots that I have been hearing since I arrived. They are very well camouflaged... See if you can spot them here.</p>
        <p>
 
        <a href="style/parrot.jpg">
    <img src="style/parrot.jpg"
         onmouseover="this.src='style/parrot2.jpg';"
         onmouseout="this.src='style/parrot.jpg';"
         width="300">
    </img>
</a></p> 
		<p>Hover the mouse over the image to see where the parrots are. I'm playing about with a new bit of code that does that, so hopefully it'll work...</p>
		<p>I know it's not a great image, but given that it's taken me four months to actually spot them and then they flew off when I tried to get closer, I was happy just to have spotted them.</p>

        <h1>Tuesday 6th January</h1>
        <p>Death by fruit salad :-p</p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/fruit2.jpg" width="600"   alt="fruit2" /></span></p> 
 
        <p>I went to the market today to get some fresh fruit and veg, and can't believe how cheap it all is compared to the supermarket, and how fresh. I got the bounty above for less than &pound;4! The cherries were about 25p, the blueberries were 90p, the onions 50p, the garlic was 10p, and I splashed out &pound;1.80 on the figs, which are beautiful (and which the stalls didn't sell in smaller quantities). I have spent a yummy afternoon just munching on the figs while I've unpacked some stuff. Heaven. it's definitely worth the half hour on the crowded metro for such good food.</p>
