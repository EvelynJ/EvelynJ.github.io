        <h1>Wednesday 31st December</h1>
        <h1>Part 2. Late Afternoon</h1>
        <p>It's New Years Eve, and with a German boyfriend, I can't avoid sharing a German new years tradition with you. Every year on New Years Eve, Germans watch the video below many many times, and find it hilarious. I think we saw it three times last year! Anyway, as you will see, it's a very English sketch that is little known in the UK, but a major hit in Germany.</p>

        <p>Skip the first three minutes or so to get past the German introduction. Since the Germans watch it in English, they need that introduction to follow whats going on...</p>

        <h1>Wednesday 31st December</h1>
        <h1>Part 1. Early Morning</h1>
        <p>Tonight I have been downgraded to a 'decorative astronomer'. Basically, they are using the VLTI setup tonight, in which three of the big telescopes work together to make up one super telescope, and mine is one of the ones involved. The wee tiny telescopes in the photos, the Pacman telescopes, usually work in this format. But tonight we have some visitors who want to use the big telescopes together to observe some really faint galaxies. As a result, they've taken over my telescope, and I just hang around in case they hand the telescope back to me before the end of the night.</p>    
        <p>On the bright side, since I didn't have to set up the calibrations during twilight, I went up to the platform to see the sunset. It was pretty. I was up there as people were opening the dome enclosures, as you can see in the photos below.</p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/telescopes1.jpg" width="600"   alt="Pacman telescopes" /></span></p> 
 
        <p>As you might remember, these are the telescopes that look like PacMan when they are open. I think they are remaining closed tonight because we are using the big telescopes instead. But these wee ones move around the platform to make different configurations, and I took this photo as it's the closest together I've ever seen them.</p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/telescopes3.jpg" width="600"   alt="UT1 opening" /></span></p> 
 
        <p>This photo centers on UT1, my telescope, shown with two of the wee ones for scale. You can see the front of the enclosure, which is the wind shield, opening as there is no wind right now.</p>
        <div style="width:600px; height:540px; border:1px solid red; padding:5px;">
		<img alt="telescopes4" src="style/telescopes4.jpg" style="width:295px;  border:1px solid blue; float:left;" />
		<img alt="new_year" src="style/happy_new_year.jpg" style="width:295px;  border:1px solid blue; float:right;" />
		</div>
    	<p>On the left is another photo showing the wind shield opening. In this case, UT1 on the left is almost fully open, UT2 in the middle is still closed, and UT3 on the right is fully open. These telescopes also have more exotic names- Antu, Keuyen, Melipal and Yepun, which means Sun, Moon, Southern Cross and Venus in Mapuche, one of the local tribal languages. But I can never remember which one is which, so everyone just uses UT1, 2, 3 and 4. UT stands for Unit Telescope, and the wee ones are ATs, Auxiliary Telescopes.</p>
 		<p>Finally, there's not much more for me to say except Happy New Year :-)</p>

        <h1>Tuesday 30th December</h1>
        <p>OK, now I'm scared. I think I've discovered what ESO does to people who make mistakes. I have to be on my best behaviour now...</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/menu.jpg" width="600"   alt="menu" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>Check out the third option for main course from last nights dinner menu. The kitchen staff make up the menu each day, and we can only assume they run it through Google translate to get the English version. As a result, we often get unusual, and sometimes hilarious, translations.</p> 
        
        <p>Incidentally, I went for the turkey curry, as did most other people. We couldn't actually identify what the roasted German offering was.</p>
