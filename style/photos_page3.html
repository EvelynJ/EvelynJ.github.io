        <h1>Friday 26th December</h1>
        <p>I woke up this morning to images of my crazy brother preparing for a Boxing Day swim. Well, I too have done a Boxing Day swim, and even a Christmas Day swim. Mine may not have been quite so challenging as Gregs, but it was certainly far warmer and in a nicer environment.</p>
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/greg_swim.jpg" width="600"   alt="greg_swim" /></span></p> 
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/eve_swim.jpg" width="600"   alt="eve_swim" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>I've included Gregs photo as Anita and Eamonn have this website address as well, and may have missed out on that photo.</p>    
        <p>Anyway, it's my second night observing, and we have poor weather conditions- there's a lot of thin cloud which means that we can't take an sensitive data. Instead, we are taking a series of images for outreach purposes, which will one day be used to create the pretty pictures you see of galaxies on publicity information. The galaxy below is the first one we have observed (and we are still taking images of it now), and is still the raw image, before any processing to remove artifacts from the CCD, such as dead pixels and the gap between the two CCDs that is clearly visible across the middle of the image. We are taking a series of photos using UV, blue, yellow and red filters, which will be put together to make a pretty, colourful image of the galaxy. The reason we use so many different filters is because the CCDs can only detect light, not colour, so all images are in black and white. The filters are also useful for showing different information about the target. For example, young stars and star-forming regions are very blue, so show up brightly in the blue filter but are almost invisible in the red filters. In turn, the red filters show up the old stars better, as they shine red, and the intermediate age stars shine brightest in the yellow light. By putting the different images in different filters together we can get a pretty image that shows all this information. I've also attached an image of the same galaxy that I found on Google, in which you can kindof see the different colours.</p>

        <h1>Thursday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Merry Christmas :-)  </p>
        
        <p>Well, We didn't see him flyign through the sky last night, But Santa did make an appearance in the residencia to bring all the presents for the families of those who had to work over Christmas. They also organised a mini disco for the kids with snacks and drinks. They even gave us a glass of wine with dinner- normally alcohol is forbidden up here except for special occasions. </p>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/santa1.jpg" width="300"   alt="santa1" /></span></p> 
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/santa2.jpg" width="600"   alt="santa2" /></span></p> 
  
         <p>Sorry for the poor quality of the photos. However, Santa didn't just visit the children here, he also left some gifts for those of us who were working...</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/xmas_chocs.jpg" width="600"   alt="xmas chocs" /></span></p> 
  
        <p>Well, I say working. It was my first night, which is an overlap night to really jut get you into night shift mode before you start properly the next day. Since my overlap night started on Christmas Eve, my trainor said I could take the evening off and enjoy the festivities instead. So technically I start work this evening at 6pm.</p>

        <h1>Wednesday 24th December</h1>
        <p>It's always interesting to fly on Christmas Eve to see what people are trying to take with them. Here in Chile, the local airlines aren't stingy about baggage allowance, allowing you two suitcases up to 23kg plus two items of hand baggage. People are really making the most of that allowance here, taking massive bags of christmas presents home with them. I even saw someone with a box for a freezer on a trolly. I have no idea what was in the box, but it looked unopened. Anyway, to get you into the festive mood, at the airport and on the plane they are giving away lots of free goodies. You can see below the treats I was given. </p>
