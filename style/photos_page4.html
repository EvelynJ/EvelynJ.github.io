        <h1>Monday 29th December</h1>
        <p>No photos today, I slept in until about 3:30 then wend for a swim before breakfast. It's now 7pm, and I've been at the telescopes since about 5:30 for the afternoon meeting between all departments, where we catch up on the status of faults and issues, and generally pass the blame in a friendly way to all those who are off having a nice holiday for christmas :-p </p>
        <p>Anyway, in lieu of a photo, I thought you might like to see the telescope I'm responsible for tonight, which is my first night going it alone. This video will give you a brief overview of what the telescope looks like, and where the different instruments sit. Enjoy.</p>

        <h1>Sunday 28th December</h1>
        <p>Night 4, and it's my last night of training before going it alone. Theoretically, I should have had another training session, so I think everyone is on standby for me mucking things up. On the bright side, I can get away with anything and the blame lies with the person making the schedule.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, here's just a random collection of photos I took today around the residencia.</p>    
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/fire_engine2.jpg" width="600"   alt="fire_engine" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>We're in the middle of the desert, but we still need water. As I was reading this afternoon with the window opened, this fire engine arrived to refill the water tanks. I just thought it looked a bit out of place.</p>    
        <div style="width:600px; height:540px; border:1px solid red; padding:5px;">
		<img alt="selfie stick" src="style/star_walk.jpg" style="width:295px;  border:1px solid blue; float:left;" />
		<img alt="fragile ladies" src="style/palm_tree.jpg" style="width:295px;  border:1px solid blue; float:right;" />
		</div>
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/palm_trees.jpg" width="600"   alt="palm_trees" /></span></p>
        <p>Talking about things being out of place, how about some palm trees. This collection of trees lies at the top of the path to the residencia, and always strikes me as a bit odd. Especially the tree that looks to be tied up to keep it standing. The final photo is the start of the star walk, the path that leads up to the telescopes from the VLT. I'm planning to walk up one day when I have the energy, though there are crazy people that run up there regularly. Crazy people.</p>

        <h1>Saturday 27th December</h1>
        <p>Technically, it's after midnight, and therefore I can add another day's worth of photos before you've even gotten up and seen yesterdays. As you can see, we continued observing more outreach images, and stumbled across the eye of Sauron :-p</p>
        
        <p><span class="centre"><img src="style/eye_of_sauron.jpg" width="600"   alt="eye_of_sauron" /></span></p> 
        
        <p>And yes, I am only pretending to work in this photo. But shush...</p>
